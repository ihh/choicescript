Title:
Bay City High School

Tagline:
Who enrolled you in Bay City High School? When? And to what purpose?

Summary:
Back To The Future meets Leisure Suit Larry (while running from Primer, Twelve Monkeys, Groundhog Day and Lost).


Vignettes:
Detention. An ill-advised quip to your buddies lands you in trouble. The school disciplinarian spoils a chance to get $Girl of your dreams.
The Device. $Mentor of your choosing shows you a $TimeMachine. (The machine can depend on $Mentor; e.g. the dropout has a hip-flask, the smart entrepreneur a Primer-like box, the wacko inventor has a velocity-activated device that must be smuggled on board a plane, there might be a Tardis somewhere, etc.)
Back to the Eighties. You return to your parents' youth, the 1980s, tripping all kinds of paradoxes (over-the-top Oedipal, pop-culture, absurdly technological, etc). You notice someone who looks just like your buddy from 2010. You flirt with $EightiesGirl of choice.
Deja-vu. You re-live the day's events, noticing increasingly disturbing inconsistencies. $EightiesGirl is now a cougar, and hits on you. Eventually your mentor explains (in any one of several ways) that you have caused a paradox and must go back to the 1980's.
Future Detour. You attempt to use the $TimeMachine again, to go back, but it malfunctions and shows you a terrifying glimpse of the 2050's, unless you fix things.
Back to the Fifties. Catapulted back to the 1950's, not the 1980's that you were aiming for, you have a couple of encounters (beatniks, greasers, Los Alamos physicists). You flirt with $FiftiesGirl and are rescued from a predicament by your buddy. He hasn't aged a day in 60 years.
Deja-vu Two. You are yanked forward into the 1980's. You attempt to head off / nullify your earlier self's actions, but fate thwarts you: your actions merely explain earlier coincidences. Furthermore, you notice new paradoxes/changes from your trip to the 50's. $EightiesGirl has gone weird. Worst of all, you accidentally erase your $Mentor's existence.
The Battle. Returning to 2010, you try to confront your ageless buddy. Following a choice of cryptic pursuits (evoking Paul Auster and Franz Kafka if at all possible), or a brutal battle if you're into that, your buddy may admit that he works for a consortium of Time Inspectors... or he may disappear using a new kind of time machine, or evade questioning altogether, etc. Somehow, you learn that he was born in the 1880's.
All the Way Back. Believing you finally understand the nature of the $TimeMachine, and that your buddy is actually your nemesis, you go back to the 1880's to prevent his birth. You meet $VictorianGirl.
Deja-vu Three. Your final run through the day's events in 2010 is full of little details that depend on your choices from earlier epochs. Default ending puts you with $Girl, but $EightiesGirl and (ew) $FiftiesGirl are now on the menu. Or you can mourn $VictorianGirl. Various new endings can be opened up, most involving dating different girls. Maybe you can also find out more about the mystery of who was behind your buddy/nemesis.

Alternative outcomes:
Failure at various points (try to keep the failure interesting).
You can hook up with $EightiesGirl (in 1980's or 2010), $FiftiesGirl (in 1950's, 1980's... 2010?), $VictorianGirl, or $Girl.
