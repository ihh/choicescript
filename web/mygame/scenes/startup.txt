Who enrolled you in Bay City High School?
When? And to what purpose?

That's what you're here to find out, dude.
Or not. Maybe.

Tubo is in your face again.

"Man! Those shorties from St Lucy sure are hot. Which do you like most?"

*choice
  #I like the blonde.
    "I like that blonde" you say vaguely.

    Tubo blinks at you. "They're all blonde. WHICH blonde?"
    *choice
      #The cheerleader.
        "Gotta love that cheerleader" you opine.

        Tubo cackles. "I know the one you mean. She does act like a cheerleader, yeah."
        *finish
      #The one with the neck ring.
        "Ohh! I never knew you was into that!"
        *finish
      #The one who stares at your shoes the whole time.
        "You know who I like?" you say. "I like the one who stares at your shoes the whole time."

        "Ha!" snorts Tubo. "Think she'd look up if you..."

        You interrupt Tubo to...
         *fake_choice
           #Slap him around the ear.
           #Protest feebly.
           #Nothing. Don't interrupt, let him finish.
        Whatever.
        *finish
  #I like the short one.
    Tubo shakes his head sadly. Just another day.
    *finish
  #I like the tall one.
    Tubo shakes his head sadly. Just another day.
    *finish
  #I like the brunette.
    Tubo shakes his head sadly. Just another day.
    *finish
  #I'm into guys.
    Tubo's eyes widen. It is the start of something.
    *finish
