  Congratulations! You finished writing something that is actually intended to be read by humans!
  *goto ending

*if vacillation > 100
  Your vacillation is so great that your great leader has his funding pulled. You are re-hired by a micromanaging obsessive, who directs your every move.
  *goto ending

What will you do next on your full-time coding project?
*choice
  #Enter it into a competition.
    There's a conference coming up in Portland - iEvoBio. You know your great leader wants to enter JBrowse for the visualization challenge. You're supposed to work on the abstract. You can do that.
    *set letmeask "Let me check in with Great Leader about the best way to proceed."
    *set wontstopme "Little things like that won't stop me."
    *label writing
    *choice
     #${letmeask} Like, what should I actually write?
      Unfortunately, you cannot find Great Leader. He must be off somewhere.
      *if vacillation > 0
        Or maybe he's at work - it's not like you're there, so you wouldn't really know.

      Congratulations. You go to a cafe and write two paragraphs.
      
      *if vacillation > 30
        You are then distracted by a loud sound.
        *goto donewriting        
      *elseif vacillation > 0
        Unfortunately, you then leave to find a cafe with wifi, and spend the rest of your day reading email.
        *goto donewriting        
      *else
        Unfortunately, you then leave to find a cafe with wifi, and spend the rest of your day reading technical white papers that are (at best) distantly related to your project.

  #Write a journal article about it.
    There's a Current Protocols article due in June. You can start writing something on that.
    *set letmeask "I know our leader has some pretty good ideas about this."
    *set wontstopme "There's no time to waste stalling."
    *goto writing
  #Help apply it to a big project.
    The modENCODE browser is a pretty high-profile project. You can help with that.

    You spend a productive few days and nights trawling through data issues and writing illuminating posts to mailing lists. Of course, there is always more to do...

    You think, but it doesn't seem to do any good.
